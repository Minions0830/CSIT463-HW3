You may also find additional images by searching internet for “under exposed” images. Underexposed means, the images are dark. Please follow the following steps for this assignment:
1.	Use the attached test PGM images. For your convenience, a color version of these images are also available in JPEG format.  If you obtain any images from the internet, please, convert them to gray scale using a program or software packages, such as Image Magick.  
2.	Obtain the gray scale frequency distribution of each image.
3.	Plot the histograms images using Excel, Gnu plot or a suitable software.
4.	Apply your histogram equalization function to images and obtain new images.
5.	Obtain the gray scale frequency distribution of new images.
6.	 Plot the histograms of new images using Excel, Gnu plot or a suitable software.
7.	Write a paper that explains the effect of the histogram equalization on images. Include the images and their respective histogram plots in the paper to explain the process and outcomes.
